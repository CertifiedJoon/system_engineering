2. system design
4. component design
5. component dev
6. component validate + integrate

disadv:
1. conflicts with procurement model
2. some components are interconnected so they cannot be delivered
incrementally

1. inflexible to change
2. insufficient project specification is catastrophic

Benefits of scrum
1. involvement of customer in the loop

3. communication
4. iterative approach helps process maturation
